# curve-fitting-talk

"Fret not, it's curve fitting all the way down!

To be presented at [Digility 2018](https://www.digility.de).

## overview

The audience at the Digility 2018 will be comprised of individuals interested in machine learning and data science, and, more importantly, how they can use it in the context of AR and VR. My intended audience are not necessarily practitioners of machine learning; additionally, they might have, at most, remembered 1st year undergraduate calculus. They may have heard the terms "linear regression", "logistic regression", "deep neural nets", and "hierarchical Bayes", but might not necessarily know how these terms connect with one another.

Thus, the intent of my talk is to demystify machine learning for Digility attendees, by sharing my epiphanies 

In the first act, I will use a series of simple to understand diagrams to show how parameter estimation, regression, classification, and deep learning can be connected under the an "estimation and curve fitting" paradigm. In addition to that, I will show how there are Bayesian interpretations of each of the above.

In the second act, I will then use two examples, one from the world of science and one from the world of sports, to show how to use a probabilistic programming language, PyMC3, to flexibly build these models. Along the way, I'll use QR codes to hopefully spark ideas for my audience on how they can connect data, models, uncertainty, and the digital world together.
