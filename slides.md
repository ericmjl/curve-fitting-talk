# Goal

1. Contextualize ML in an application developer's toolbox. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
1. Demystify ML model classes with pictures and as few equations as possible. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Agenda

1. Context: ML in a developer's toolkit
1. Model Classes
  1. Linear Models
  1. Deep neural network Models
  1. Bayesian models
  1. Tree-based models

# ML In Your Toolkit

Machine learning:

- maps inputs to outputs <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- which are too complex and/or tedious for us to hand-code rules for <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- using lots of data. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----

## Example 1

Identifying objects in a picture.

----

## Example 2

Taking speech inputs and returning text.

# ML In Your Toolkit

Machine learning systems learn a complicated function for you.
